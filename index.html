            <h3>Kananga, DR Congo</h3>
            <img src="images/drc-flag.webp" alt="River Rafting" width="200">
            <p>Kananga is a prominent city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
               serves as the capital of Kasai-Central Province. Formerly known as Luluabourg,
               it was renamed in 1966 and derives its name from a local Tshiluba word 
               meaning “place of peace.” Located near the Lulua River, Kananga is a key
               commercial and administrative center with road, rail, and air links to other
               major cities. The city is also home to universities and educational institutions,
               making it an important academic hub. Despite facing challenges like infrastructure
               limitations, Kananga remains vital to the region's cultural, political, and
               economic development.
